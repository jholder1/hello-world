# hello-world
brand new programmer
Hello everyone! James here. I'm a 31y.o. controls engineer in the energy sector, and I have zero experience with traditional programming. My goal is to learn enough to become dangerous and hopefully increase my productivity and ability to converse on programming topics. Plus, this is a major life goal of mine, so there's that! Glad to be here finally!
